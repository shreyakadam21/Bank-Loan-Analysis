# Bank-Loan-Analysis

# Problem Statement
In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

# Dashboard 1: Summary
# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Total Loan Applications: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including 
 Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
 
2. Total Funded Amount: Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount, and 
 analyze MoM changes.
 
3. Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, 
 including MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.
 
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.

5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, 
  and track MoM fluctuations.

# Loan Status Grid View
To gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations, we will create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status'. This report will analyze key indicators associated with different loan statuses, including 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'MTD Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)'.
