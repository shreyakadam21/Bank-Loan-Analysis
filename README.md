# Bank-Loan-Analysis

# Problem Statement
In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

# Dashboard 1: Summary
# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Total Loan Applications: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including 
 Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
 
2. Total Funded Amount: Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount, and 
 analyze MoM changes.
 
3. Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, 
 including MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.
 
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.

5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, 
  and track MoM fluctuations.
# Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs
**Good Loan KPIs:**
- Good Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans' (status: 'Fully Paid' and 'Current').
- Good Loan Applications: Identify the total number of 'Good Loan' applications.
- Good Loan Funded Amount: Determine the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans'.
- Good Loan Total Received Amount: Track the total amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans'.
  
**Bad Loan KPIs:**
- Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the percentage of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans' (status: 'Charged Off').
- Bad Loan Applications: Identify the total number of 'Bad Loan' applications.
- Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determine the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans'.
- Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Track the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans'.

**Loan Status Grid View**

To gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations, we will create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status'. This report will analyze key indicators associated with different loan statuses, including 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'MTD Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)'.
# Dashboard 1: Overview
In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using various chart types to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
**1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):**
Chart Type: Line Chart

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

X-Axis: Month (based on 'Issue Date')

Y-Axis: Metrics' Values

Objective: This line chart will showcase how 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received' vary over time, allowing us to identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

**2. Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):**
Chart Type: Filled Map

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Geographic Regions: States

Objective: This filled map will visually represent lending metrics categorized by state, enabling us to identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.

**3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):**
Chart Type: Donut Chart

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Segments: Loan Terms (e.g., 36 months, 60 months)

Objective: This donut chart will depict loan statistics based on different loan terms, allowing us to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

**4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):**
Chart Type: Bar Chart

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

X-Axis: Employee Length Categories (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 10+ years)

Y-Axis: Metrics' Values

Objective: This bar chart will illustrate how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.

**5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):**
Chart Type: Bar Chart

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

X-Axis: Loan Purpose Categories (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing)

Y-Axis: Metrics' Values

Objective: This bar chart will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.

**6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):**
Chart Type: Tree Map

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Hierarchy: Home Ownership Categories (e.g., own, rent, mortgage)

Objective: This tree map will display loan metrics categorized by different home ownership statuses, allowing for a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
